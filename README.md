**Proplem statement** :

Vrinda store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that, Vrinda can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2023.

**Challenges in this project**:

I made all steps in this project with Excel and google looker studio in tne following steps:

1- Data cleaning and processing 

2- Design a dashboard with looker studio , with its help i could extract important insights from data

**Insights**

* The revenue for the store in 2022 was 21.2M  .
  
* total orders was 31K and we delivered 93% of them ( only we had 7% returned and cancelled)

**Monthly KPI for sales was as the following**:

   - Top sales was in the March (more than 1.9 millon) , this could be due to the fact that with the beginning of a new season (the spring), the purchase of products increases

   - The second top in sales was in the july( more than 1.8 million ) , this also due to the summer .

   - with the end of year (from august to december ) the sales began to decline until below the average
     - Therefore, **if we want to improve sales during this period**, we should create new offers and discounts to entice the customer and meet his needs especially the youth because they are the largest purchasing group.
    
   - Most of customers were the women (64%) and they prefered Set,Curta and western drees categories so ws should increase of these products.

  - The top channels were Amazon, Myntra and Flipkart so, we have to pay more attention to our customers on these channels and study their prefers and requirements .

**Conclusion**
The Sales Dashboard not only streamlined our sales processes but also became a potent tool to remain competitive in a swiftly changing market.

It serves as a testament to the transformative potential of data visualization when paired with the right tools and insights.
